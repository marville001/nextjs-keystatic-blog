To build a complete web application with React from scratch, there are many important details you need to consider:

- Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
- You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
- You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
- You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.

A&nbsp;*framework*&nbsp;can solve these problems. But such a framework must have the right level of abstraction — otherwise it won’t be very useful. It also needs to have great "Developer Experience", ensuring you and your team have an amazing experience while writing code.

### Next.js: The React Framework

Enter&nbsp;**Next.js**, the React Framework. Next.js provides a solution to all of the above problems. But more importantly, it puts you and your team in the&nbsp;[pit of success](https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/)&nbsp;when building React applications.

Next.js aims to have best-in-class developer experience and many built-in features, such as:

- An intuitive&nbsp;[page-based](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages)&nbsp;routing system (with support for&nbsp;[dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes))
- [Pre-rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#pre-rendering), both&nbsp;[static generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended)&nbsp;(SSG) and&nbsp;[server-side rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering)&nbsp;(SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
- Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
- [Client-side routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction#linking-between-pages)&nbsp;with optimized prefetching
- [Built-in CSS](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support)&nbsp;and&nbsp;[Sass support](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#sass-support), and support for any&nbsp;[CSS-in-JS](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#css-in-js)&nbsp;library
- Development environment with&nbsp;[Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/fast-refresh)&nbsp;support
- [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)&nbsp;to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
- Fully extendable

Next.js is used in tens of thousands of production-facing websites and web applications, including many of the world's largest brands.
